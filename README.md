# Internal Requests Management - Frontend

This repository contains the code for the frontend of the internal requests management application developed in React with Vite. The project is designed to track and control internal requests made in the "El Surtidor BG SAS" warehouse by employees to the purchasing office.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** Fast build tool for modern frontend projects.
- **Redux:** Library for managing global application state.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Node.js:** [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm:** Node Package Manager, usually included with Node.js. You can check if it is installed by running `npm -v` in your terminal.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project in your local environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wfgp12/solicitudes-surtidor-front
```

2. **Go to the project directory:**
  ```bash
  cd solicitudes-surtidor-front
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
  npm install
  //or
  yarn install
```

4. **Start the server**
```bash
  npm start
  //or
  yarn start
```

<!-- 
## Run in Docker

Clone the project
```bash
  git clone 
  // or
  git clone 
```

Go to the project directory
```bash
  cd taller-3-microservicios
```

Build the container image on your local machine and start the container with the following command:
```bash
  docker-compose up --build --no-recreate -d
```

This command only needs to be run the first time, and whenever you make changes to the docker-compose.yml file. For subsequent runs, you can use:
```bash
  docker-compose up -d
```
With this, you will have the project up and running, either locally or via Docker.

**IMPORTANT:!** It is necessary to have docker installed and running, to be able to run the above command line successfully.
